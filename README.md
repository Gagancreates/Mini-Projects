🌍 Full-Stack Learning Projects

Hey there! This is my collection of mini projects as I dive deep into Full-Stack Development. Instead of just reading and watching tutorials, I’m applying what I learn by building things—because I beleive that's the best way to learn! 🚀

🔥 What’s in this repo?

Mini-projects based on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Next.js, Node.js, and Firebase
Simple, practical implementations of full-stack concepts
Code that’s (hopefully) clean and easy to understand 

🛠 Tech Stack

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Next.js
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: Firebase (for now, but more to come!)
Deployment & Tools: Vercel, GitHub, Postman

 Why am I doing this?

Tbh just for fun :)
To implement what I learn by actually building stuff
